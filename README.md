# Predictive-Modeling-for-Client-Satisfaction-in-Steel-Manufacturing


Conducted a comprehensive predictive modeling project focused on analyzing factors influencing client satisfaction within the steel manufacturing industry. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation using advanced machine learning techniques.

Key Achievements:

Data Preprocessing and Analysis: Successfully cleaned and transformed a large dataset containing 17,944 entries across 23 variables, focusing on key metrics related to client interactions and satisfaction.
Model Development: Built and evaluated multiple predictive models, including Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The GBR model demonstrated the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, making it ideal for real-time applications.
Model Performance and Insights: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R², and identified key predictors of client satisfaction, such as 'SESSIONS_YEAR' and 'AVERAGE_ACTIONS'. Provided actionable insights for improving customer engagement and satisfaction through enhanced digital platform interactions.
Technical Reporting: Developed a detailed technical report, including an executable Python notebook and an HTML version for reproducibility, showcasing the entire modeling process from data exploration to final recommendations.
